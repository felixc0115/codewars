/*
The goal of this kata is two-fold:

1.) You must produce a fibonacci sequence in the form of an array, containing a number of items equal to the input provided.

2.) You must replace all numbers in the sequence divisible by 3 with Fizz, those divisible by 5 with Buzz, and those divisible by both 3 and 5 with FizzBuzz.

For the sake of this kata, you can assume all input will be a positive integer.
